build process
=============

ABANDONED PROJECT.
JUST USE CMAKE... ;)


this package is a build process for C++ and C.

full-featured build is located in build_process/ directory. it is able to build static and dynamic
libraries as long as applications. it integrates automated and manual tests, doxygen documentation
and debug/release building modes. it also offers advanced setups, for conditional code inclusion,
per-profile settings, flags and components list to compile.

simpler build, for small projects is placed under small_prj_build_process/ directory. it is
targeted for systems where components division is not required (i.e. build all as one applications
is fine).

trivial build, for one-directory projects, consisting of just a few files, with no tests, etc...
this is the simples one can get, without a need to write anything. ;)

nano build compiles each source, in a currect directory into a separate application. useful for
creating small test sources, helpers, proof-of-concepts and side projects.

both build systems generate all output and temporary files inside gen/ directory. this makes it
easy to clean and maintain. additionally each setup for build is generated inside separate
sub-directory within gen/, making it possible to build ex. debug and release independently,
without need for cleaning anything.
